       " There was a recent incident in practice where Stefon Diggs and Dak Prescott had a verbal altercation.  Some people believe that this incident is a sign of tension between Diggs and Prescott.  Head coach Mike McCarthy downplayed the incident, saying that it is normal for teammates to talk trash to each other in practice.  Overall, it appears that the incident between Diggs and Prescott was just a minor disagreement that has been blown out of proportion by the media.\n",
       "\n",
       "Trash-talking is part of the environment in the NFL.  Chemistry issues usually surface after a bad start to the regular season.  The Cowboys may have had a chemistry issue two years ago when they faced the 49ers in the playoffs.  The Cowboys seem to have cured their chemistry issue last year.  The Cowboys seem more confident and together than any team in recent memory.  Mike McCarthy and Will McClay deserve credit for this, as they have drafted players like Dax who fit this mold.\n",

       "There are a lot of reasons why the Cowboys have not been able to win a Super Bowl in recent years. Some people say that it is because they have not had a good enough quarterback.

If the players on a team do not get along, it can be difficult for them to win games.\n",

However, there have also been reports that the Cowboys do not have chemistry issues. These reports have come from national reporters, who are more likely to publish clickbait headlines without any substance.\n",

       " The cost of living in California is among the highest in the United States. This is largely due to the high cost of housing, which is driven by a number of factors, including the state's strong economy, high demand for housing, and limited supply of land.  The median home price in California is over $600,000, which is more than double the national median. Property taxes are also high in California, averaging over $7,000 per year. This is due to the state's high property values and the fact that California has a relatively low property tax rate.  In contrast, the cost of living in Texas is generally lower than in California. The median home price in Texas is around $200,000, and property taxes are much lower, averaging around $2,500 per year. This is because Texas has a lower property tax rate and a higher state income tax.  The cost of cigarettes is also higher in California than in Texas. A pack of cigarettes costs around $7.62 in California, while it costs around $5.62 in Texas. This is due to the fact that California has a higher cigarette tax than Texas.  Despite the high cost of living, California is still a popular place to live. The state's strong economy, mild climate, and beautiful scenery make it an attractive destination for people from all over the country."

While he was eating, she called the cops.  In a heartwarming story, a shrimp fisherman in the Netherlands lost an earring at sea 23 years ago. Another boat found the earring on their deck 23 years later and posted a picture of it on social media. The original owner saw the post and was reunited with his earring.  A man in a nearby boat recognized the earring and said it was his. The earring was a silhouette of a troller that sank 36 years ago. The man had kept the earring from the boat he had worked on.  The author found a message in a bottle that had been thrown overboard 36 years earlier. The author used to throw messages in bottles into the ocean as a child, and they never got a response. The author thinks it would be cool to find a message in a bottle.  A man received a letter that was likely damaged by his neighbor's tree.  Two men got into an argument at a Sonic and Tolsa.  One of the men picked up a flag pole with an American flag on it and ran it through the other guy's head. The victim survived but will likely lose an eye."

Last season, quarterbacks accounted for 20.1% of all rushing touchdowns in the league, compared to only 11% in 2010. This trend is likely due to the increasing importance of mobility and athleticism in the quarterback position. Quarterbacks are now leading the NFL in sales of officially licensed player products, with Patrick Mahomes leading the league in sales during the first quarter of the new NFL calendar. This suggests that the trend is shifting towards dual-threat signal callers, and that the importance of running backs may be declining.\n",

Some people believe that this incident is a sign of tension between Diggs and Prescott.  Head coach Mike McCarthy downplayed the incident, saying that it is normal for teammates to talk trash to each other in practice.  Overall, it appears that the incident between Diggs and Prescott was just a minor disagreement that has been blown out of proportion by the media.\n",

       "Trash-talking is part of the environment in the NFL.  Chemistry issues usually surface after a bad start to the regular season.  The Cowboys may have had a chemistry issue two years ago when they faced the 49ers in the playoffs.  The Cowboys seem to have cured their chemistry issue last year.  The Cowboys seem more confident and together than any team in recent memory.  Mike McCarthy and Will McClay deserve credit for this, as they have drafted players like Dax who fit this mold.\n",

The leadership of players like Amari Cooper and DeMarcus Lawrence is also a reason why the team's chemistry is not a problem.  The recent reports of chemistry problems within the team are overblown and the Cowboys should not be concerned about them."

       " There was a recent incident in practice where Stefon Diggs and Dak Prescott had a verbal altercation.  Some people believe that this incident is a sign of tension between Diggs and Prescott.  Head coach Mike McCarthy downplayed the incident, saying that it is normal for teammates to talk trash to each other in practice.  Overall, it appears that the incident between Diggs and Prescott was just a minor disagreement that has been blown out of proportion by the media.  Trash-talking is part of the environment in the NFL.  Chemistry issues usually surface after a bad start to the regular season.  The Cowboys may have had a chemistry issue two years ago when they faced the 49ers in the playoffs.  The Cowboys seem to have cured their chemistry issue last year.  The Cowboys seem more confident and together than any team in recent memory.  Mike McCarthy and Will McClay deserve credit for this, as they have drafted players like Dax who fit this mold.  The text suggests that the Dallas Cowboys have intentionally built a team of players who are not only talented, but also have good character.  The author believes that the Dallas Cowboys do not have a chemistry problem."

Last season, that number had jumped to 20.1%. This trend is likely due to the increasing importance of mobility and athleticism in the quarterback position.\n",

       "This trend is also reflected in the sales of officially licensed player products. Quarterbacks now lead the NFL in sales, with Patrick Mahomes leading the league in sales during the first quarter of the new NFL calendar. This suggests that the trend is shifting towards dual-threat signal callers, and that the importance of running backs may be declining.\n",
       "\n",
       "The Cowboys are no exception to this trend. Three Cowboys made the top 10 in sales of officially licensed player products, with Dak Prescott at number 7 and CeeDee Lamb at number 9. Interestingly, a lot of people are also wearing jersey number 11, which is most likely a nod to former Cowboys quarterback Danny White. White is still in the top 10 in jersey sales, even though he retired over 30 years ago.\n",
