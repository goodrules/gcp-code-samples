She's not particularly loyal or engaged. She's likely price-sensitive and driven by immediate needs.\n",
       "    *   **Title Label:** \"Occasional Spender\"\n",

       "    *   **Persona:** *Name:* Kevin. *Description:* Kevin likes the brand and buys relatively frequently, but he's price-conscious. He's likely looking for good deals and value for his money. He may be a regular user of the product/service but isn't necessarily a high-roller.\n",
       "    *   **Title Label:** \"Frequent Value Shopper\"\n",

       "    *   **Title Label:** \"High-Value, Infrequent Purchaser\"\n",

       "    *   **Title Label:** \"Lapsed Loyal Customer\"\n",

       "    *   **Persona:** *Name:*  Sarah. *Description:* Sarah visited the store once, made a small purchase, and hasn't been back since. She may have been a one-time visitor driven by a specific need or promotion. She likely doesn't have a strong connection with the brand.\n",
       "    *   **Title Label:** \"One-Time Buyer\"\n",
