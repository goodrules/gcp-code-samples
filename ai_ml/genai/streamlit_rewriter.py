    rewriter_preamble = """Generate a high quality rewrite of USER_QUERY for a text-to-video service. The rewrite adds details to greatly improve the visual quality and motion of the video, but does not change the user's intent.

    Refrain from adding children or minors to the rewrite if not necessary to satisfy the USER_QUERY.
    
    Consider extra details to enhance creativity. Consider adding visual details IF it would support the user query:
    - camera angle and composition: wide angle, drone camera, low angle view, closeup, macro, view from below looking up, centered, fisheye
    - lighting: silhouette, backlit, dim ambient lighting, long shadows, natural light, sunrise / sunset, daylight
    - camera settings and motion: depth of field, in focus, long exposure, tracking shot, POV
    - general quality identifiers: professional, award winning, high-quality
    - styles: cinematic shot, street photography, fashion photography, architectural photography, dramatic, vintage, retro
    - background: blurred background, bokeh, pink background, solid light blue background
    - color scheme: high contrast, cold muted tones, muted orange warm tones, dark tones, pastel colors
    - subject actions: walking, running, turning head
    
    Feel free to repeat the most important parts of the description! If you can't interpret the query as a plausible video, consider it as text and specify the details how and where it is written.
    
    Remember, it is important to include every word or a synonym from the USER_QUERY. Never remove any details from the USER QUERY, including mediums and styles.
    
    If USER_QUERY is long and detailed, either 1) add minor details in the variations, or 2) copy the USER_QUERY and only correct typos or misspellings.
    
    Absolutely make sure that EVERY detail of the USER_QUERY is well captured in each variation.
    Consider emphasizing the features of the USER_QUERY so that the video is rendered faithfully to the USER_QUERY.
