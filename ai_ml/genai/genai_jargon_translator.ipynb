    "# Vertex LLM Demo: Simplify Complex Information\n",
    "\n",
    "This demo aims to distill critical points from text and informaton that is more consumable for non-experts to understand.  This could make information delivery more efficient more both the giver and receiver of information, for example a medical provider and a patient.\n",
    "\n",
    "# CUJs\n",
    "  * As a patient, I want to understand what this medical note means to me\n",
    "  * As a provider, I want to focus on critical and objective medical diagnoses and prognoses, and expedite delivery of information to patients.\n",
    "  * As a product manager, I want to understand the implications of a new technology to my product or future products.\n",
    "  * and many, many more...\n",
    "\n",
    "# What the code does\n",
    "\n",
    "  * The code takes a text as input, such as a medical chart note or complex technical explanation.\n",
    "  * It then pulls that text into a prompt, instructing the LLM to generate a  summary of the text for an individual at a more appropriate knowledge level (e.g. non-expert, patient, student).\n",
    "  * The model responds with a summary, and sometimes deeper explanations if certain terms within the summary still require expounding upon.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "To run the demo, simply run all the cells in order. The hidden cells can remain hidden and you can run the entire section at once. Note that the workspace setup will trigger a runtime restart; that is working as intended to ensure the right version of the Cloud SDK is installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Limitations and ideas for extension\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Could possibly be used in a more real-time scenario as part of a chatbot deployed by medical providers / teachers / product teams / etc..\n",
    "  * The body of text currently needs to fit within the LLM's context window. We can naively solve that problem by chunking up the original body of text and generating summaries of smaller chunks.\n",
    "  * Some of the input could be sensitive and directly impactful, e.g. in the case of medical information, so the summary would need to be validated prior to a patient, student, individual seeing to ensure minimal or no misinformation.\n",

    "*72 year old man with h/o CHF following MI, chronic renal insufficiency and venous stasis admitted with worsening edema and DOE. His symptoms are most consistent with incrasing CHF-biventricular-which would account for both his pulmonary congestion as well as his peripheral edema. His renal disease is a less likely explanation for his extensive edema as his BUN/Cr have remained stable throughout. However, his low albumin which could contribute to his edema may be due to renal losses. So if his edema is due to CHF, why has it become gradually and now acutely worse? Possibilities include: 1) worsening LV function, 2) another MI, 3) worsening valvular disease, 4) poor compliance with medications or 5) excess salt and water intake. His ECHO today shows no change in his EF, but there is marked wall motion abnormalities with akinesis. There is no evidence in his history, EKG, or enzymes for current ischemia/infarct. He does have MR and TR and his valvular disease may in part account for his worsening symptoms though his estimated PA pressure is unchanged and his LA is not dilated. The most likely precipitant of his failure is a combination of poor compliance with medication and fluid overload from excessive intake. We will continue to investigate the possibility of a structural precipitant for his deterioration and treat his current symptoms.*\n",

    "In probability theory and statistics, Bayes' theorem (alternatively Bayes' law or Bayes' rule), named after Thomas Bayes, describes the probability of an event, based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event.For example, if the risk of developing health problems is known to increase with age, Bayes' theorem allows the risk to an individual of a known age to be assessed more accurately by conditioning it relative to their age, rather than simply assuming that the individual is typical of the population as a whole.\n",
    "One of the many applications of Bayes' theorem is Bayesian inference, a particular approach to statistical inference. When applied, the probabilities involved in the theorem may have different probability interpretations. With Bayesian probability interpretation, the theorem expresses how a degree of belief, expressed as a probability, should rationally change to account for the availability of related evidence.

    "Compound interest is the addition of interest to the principal sum of a loan or deposit, or in other words, interest on principal plus interest. It is the result of reinvesting interest, or adding it to the loaned capital rather than paying it out, or requiring payment from borrower, so that interest in the next period is then earned on the principal sum plus previously accumulated interest. Compound interest is standard in finance and economics.\n",
    "Compound interest is contrasted with simple interest, where previously accumulated interest is not added to the principal amount of the current period, so there is no compounding. The simple annual interest rate is the interest amount per period, multiplied by the number of periods per year. The simple annual interest rate is also known as the nominal interest rate (not to be confused with the interest rate not adjusted for inflation, which goes by the same name).\n",

    "An application programming interface (API) is a way for two or more computer programs to communicate with each other. It is a type of software interface, offering a service to other pieces of software.[1] A document or standard that describes how to build or use such a connection or interface is called an API specification. A computer system that meets this standard is said to implement or expose an API. The term API may refer either to the specification or to the implementation.\n",
    "In contrast to a user interface, which connects a computer to a person, an application programming interface connects computers or pieces of software to each other. It is not intended to be used directly by a person (the end user) other than a computer programmer who is incorporating it into the software. An API is often made up of different parts which act as tools or services that are available to the programmer. A program or a programmer that uses one of these parts is said to call that portion of the API. The calls that make up the API are also known as subroutines, methods, requests, or endpoints. An API specification defines these calls, meaning that it explains how to use or implement them.\n",
    "One purpose of APIs is to hide the internal details of how a system works, exposing only those parts a programmer will find useful and keeping them consistent even if the internal details later change. An API may be custom-built for a particular pair of systems, or it may be a shared standard allowing interoperability among many systems.\n",
    "There are APIs for programming languages, software libraries, computer operating systems, and computer hardware. APIs originated in the 1940s, though the term did not emerge until the 1960s and 1970s. Contemporary usage of the term API often refers to web APIs,[2] which allow communication between computers that are joined by the internet. Recent developments in APIs have led to the rise in popularity of microservices, which are loosely coupled services accessed through public APIs.\n",

It is a type of software interface, offering a service to other pieces of software.[1] A document or standard that describes how to build or use such a connection or interface is called an API specification. A computer system that meets this standard is said to implement or expose an API. The term API may refer either to the specification or to the implementation.\n",
       "In contrast to a user interface, which connects a computer to a person, an application programming interface connects computers or pieces of software to each other. It is not intended to be used directly by a person (the end user) other than a computer programmer who is incorporating it into the software. An API is often made up of different parts which act as tools or services that are available to the programmer. A program or a programmer that uses one of these parts is said to call that portion of the API. The calls that make up the API are also known as subroutines, methods, requests, or endpoints. An API specification defines these calls, meaning that it explains how to use or implement them.\n",
       "One purpose of APIs is to hide the internal details of how a system works, exposing only those parts a programmer will find useful and keeping them consistent even if the internal details later change. An API may be custom-built for a particular pair of systems, or it may be a shared standard allowing interoperability among many systems.\n",
       "There are APIs for programming languages, software libraries, computer operating systems, and computer hardware. APIs originated in the 1940s, though the term did not emerge until the 1960s and 1970s. Contemporary usage of the term API often refers to web APIs,[2] which allow communication between computers that are joined by the internet. Recent developments in APIs have led to the rise in popularity of microservices, which are loosely coupled services accessed through public APIs.\n"

       "An application programming interface (API) is a way for two or more computer programs to communicate with each other. It is a type of software interface, offering a service to other pieces of software.[1] A document or standard that describes how to build or use such a connection or interface is called an API specification. A computer system that meets this standard is said to implement or expose an API. The term API may refer either to the specification or to the implementation.\n",
       "In contrast to a user interface, which connects a computer to a person, an application programming interface connects computers or pieces of software to each other. It is not intended to be used directly by a person (the end user) other than a computer programmer who is incorporating it into the software. An API is often made up of different parts which act as tools or services that are available to the programmer. A program or a programmer that uses one of these parts is said to call that portion of the API. The calls that make up the API are also known as subroutines, methods, requests, or endpoints. An API specification defines these calls, meaning that it explains how to use or implement them.\n",
       "One purpose of APIs is to hide the internal details of how a system works, exposing only those parts a programmer will find useful and keeping them consistent even if the internal details later change. An API may be custom-built for a particular pair of systems, or it may be a shared standard allowing interoperability among many systems.\n",
       "There are APIs for programming languages, software libraries, computer operating systems, and computer hardware. APIs originated in the 1940s, though the term did not emerge until the 1960s and 1970s. Contemporary usage of the term API often refers to web APIs,[2] which allow communication between computers that are joined by the internet. Recent developments in APIs have led to the rise in popularity of microservices, which are loosely coupled services accessed through public APIs.\n"

       " An API is a set of instructions that allows different software components to communicate with each other. It's like a waiter taking your order at a restaurant - the waiter doesn't need to know how the food is cooked, they just need to know what you want and how to get it to you. APIs are used to connect different parts of a software system, or to connect different software systems together. They can be used to exchange data, perform actions, or get information. APIs are essential for building complex software systems, and they're becoming increasingly important as more and more devices and services are connected to the internet."
