His symptoms are most consistent with incrasing CHF-biventricular-which would account for both his pulmonary congestion as well as his peripheral edema. His renal disease is a less likely explanation for his extensive edema as his BUN/Cr have remained stable throughout. However, his low albumin which could contribute to his edema may be due to renal losses. So if his edema is due to CHF, why has it become gradually and now acutely worse? Possibilities include: 1) worsening LV function, 2) another MI, 3) worsening valvular disease, 4) poor compliance with medications or 5) excess salt and water intake. His ECHO today shows no change in his EF, but there is marked wall motion abnormalities with akinesis. There is no evidence in his history, EKG, or enzymes for current ischemia/infarct. He does have MR and TR and his valvular disease may in part account for his worsening symptoms though his estimated PA pressure is unchanged and his LA is not dilated. The most likely precipitant of his failure is a combination of poor compliance with medication and fluid overload from excessive intake. We will continue to investigate the possibility of a structural precipitant for his deterioration and treat his current symptoms.*\n","\n","**Response - non-expert summary (text-bison-001 model)**\n","\n","*72 year old man with heart failure due to previous heart attack, kidney disease and poor circulation is admitted to hospital with worsening symptoms.

When applied, the probabilities involved in the theorem may have different probability interpretations. With Bayesian probability interpretation, the theorem expresses how a degree of belief, expressed as a probability, should rationally change to account for the availability of related evidence. Bayesian inference is fundamental to Bayesian statistics, being considered by one authority as; \"to the theory of probability what Pythagoras's theorem is to geometry.\n","\"\"\"\n",",\"\"\"\n","Compound interest is the addition of interest to the principal sum of a loan or deposit, or in other words, interest on principal plus interest. It is the result of reinvesting interest, or adding it to the loaned capital rather than paying it out, or requiring payment from borrower, so that interest in the next period is then earned on the principal sum plus previously accumulated interest. Compound interest is standard in finance and economics.\n","Compound interest is contrasted with simple interest, where previously accumulated interest is not added to the principal amount of the current period, so there is no compounding. The simple annual interest rate is the interest amount per period, multiplied by the number of periods per year. The simple annual interest rate is also known as the nominal interest rate (not to be confused with the interest rate not adjusted for inflation, which goes by the same name).\n","\"\"\"\n",",\"\"\"\n","An application programming interface (API) is a way for two or more computer programs to communicate with each other. It is a type of software interface, offering a service to other pieces of software.[1] A document or standard that describes how to build or use such a connection or interface is called an API specification. A computer system that meets this standard is said to implement or expose an API. The term API may refer either to the specification or to the implementation.\n","In contrast to a user interface, which connects a computer to a person, an application programming interface connects computers or pieces of software to each other. It is not intended to be used directly by a person (the end user) other than a computer programmer who is incorporating it into the software. An API is often made up of different parts which act as tools or services that are available to the programmer. A program or a programmer that uses one of these parts is said to call that portion of the API. The calls that make up the API are also known as subroutines, methods, requests, or endpoints. An API specification defines these calls, meaning that it explains how to use or implement them.\n","One purpose of APIs is to hide the internal details of how a system works, exposing only those parts a programmer will find useful and keeping them consistent even if the internal details later change. An API may be custom-built for a particular pair of systems, or it may be a shared standard allowing interoperability among many systems.\n","There are APIs for programming languages, software libraries, computer operating systems, and computer hardware.

A computer system that meets this standard is said to implement or expose an API. The term API may refer either to the specification or to the implementation.\nIn contrast to a user interface, which connects a computer to a person, an application programming interface connects computers or pieces of software to each other. It is not intended to be used directly by a person (the end user) other than a computer programmer who is incorporating it into the software. An API is often made up of different parts which act as tools or services that are available to the programmer. A program or a programmer that uses one of these parts is said to call that portion of the API. The calls that make up the API are also known as subroutines, methods, requests, or endpoints. An API specification defines these calls, meaning that it explains how to use or implement them.\nOne purpose of APIs is to hide the internal details of how a system works, exposing only those parts a programmer will find useful and keeping them consistent even if the internal details later change. An API may be custom-built for a particular pair of systems, or it may be a shared standard allowing interoperability among many systems.\nThere are APIs for programming languages, software libraries, computer operating systems, and computer hardware. APIs originated in the 1940s, though the term did not emerge until the 1960s and 1970s. Contemporary usage of the term API often refers to web APIs,[2] which allow communication between computers that are joined by the internet.

Typical features of ischemia are symptoms that are more common with a heart attack. Myocardial infarction is a medical term for a heart attack. Serial troponins are tests that are used to measure the levels of a protein called troponin in the blood. Troponin is a protein that is released from the heart muscle when the heart is damaged.

If you are interested in learning more about Bayes' theorem, there are many resources available online and in libraries.\n\nHere is a simple example of how Bayes' theorem can be used. Let's say that you have a medical test that is 99% accurate in detecting a disease. This means that if you have the disease, the test will be positive 99% of the time. It also means that if you don't have the disease, the test will be negative 99% of the time.\n\nNow, let's say that you take the test and it is positive. What is the probability that you actually have the disease?\n\nTo answer this question, we can use Bayes' theorem. The theorem states that the probability of an event happening, given some evidence, is equal to the probability of the evidence happening, given the event, times the prior probability of the event, divided by the probability of the evidence happening.\n\nIn this case, the event is that you have the disease, the evidence is that the test is positive, and the prior probability is the probability that you have the disease before you take the test.\n\nWe can write Bayes' theorem as follows:\n\n$$P(D|E) = \\frac{P(E|D) \\times P(D)}{P(E)}$$\n\nwhere $P(D|E)$ is the probability of the disease given the evidence, $P(E|D)$ is the probability of the evidence given the disease, $P(D)$ is the prior probability of the disease, and $P(E)$ is the probability of the evidence.\n\nIn this case, we know that $P(E|D) = 0.99$, $P(D) = 0.01$, and $P(E) = 0.1$. Substituting these values into the equation, we get:\n\n$$P(D|E) = \\frac{0.99 \\times 0.01}{0.1} = 0.99$$\n\nThis means that there is a 99% chance that you have the disease, given that the test is positive.\n\nOf course, this is just a simple example. In real-world situations, Bayes' theorem can be used to calculate the probability of much more complex events. However, the basic principle is the same: Bayes' theorem allows us to use evidence to update our beliefs about the probability of an event happening."},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["<IPython.core.display.Markdown object>"],"text/markdown":"-------------------------------------"},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["<IPython.core.display.Markdown object>"],"text/markdown":"## Original text"},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["<IPython.core.display.Markdown object>"],"text/markdown":"Compound interest is when you earn interest on your interest.

However, it is important to note that compound interest can also work against you if you have a negative balance in your account. For example, if you have a \\$1000 loan at an interest rate of 5%, and you compound interest annually, you will owe \\$1050 at the end of the year. However, if you compound interest quarterly, you will owe \\$1047.22 at the end of the year. This is because you are earning interest on the interest that you have already owed.\n\nIt is important to understand the difference between compound interest and simple interest before you take out a loan. Compound interest can help you earn more money over time, but it can also work against you if you have a negative balance in your account."},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["<IPython.core.display.Markdown object>"],"text/markdown":"-------------------------------------"},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["<IPython.core.display.Markdown object>"],"text/markdown":"## Original text"},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["<IPython.core.display.Markdown object>"],"text/markdown":"An application programming interface (API) is a way for two or more computer programs to communicate with each other.

When applied, the probabilities involved in the theorem may have different probability interpretations.

A computer system that meets this standard is said to implement or expose an API. The term API may refer either to the specification or to the implementation.\nIn contrast to a user interface, which connects a computer to a person, an application programming interface connects computers or pieces of software to each other. It is not intended to be used directly by a person (the end user) other than a computer programmer who is incorporating it into the software. An API is often made up of different parts which act as tools or services that are available to the programmer. A program or a programmer that uses one of these parts is said to call that portion of the API. The calls that make up the API are also known as subroutines, methods, requests, or endpoints. An API specification defines these calls, meaning that it explains how to use or implement them.\nOne purpose of APIs is to hide the internal details of how a system works, exposing only those parts a programmer will find useful and keeping them consistent even if the internal details later change. An API may be custom-built for a particular pair of systems, or it may be a shared standard allowing interoperability among many systems.\nThere are APIs for programming languages, software libraries, computer operating systems, and computer hardware. APIs originated in the 1940s, though the term did not emerge until the 1960s and 1970s.
